<h1>You Shouldn't Let One Bad Apple Ruin the Bunch</h1>
<body>
    Considering the complete timeline of human civilization the Internet is a fairly new invention. Over the last few decades the internet has evolved to play a very significant role in everyoneâ€™s day to day life. As the Internet began as a luxury for a select few, it is now necessary to be a functioning member of society. On the surface the internet seems like a chill and convenient resource to quickly convert a measurement or google an actor whose name you can't remember however, the Internet has a very dark side. People can abuse the Internet. They can become to dependent on the tool and end up in a bad place. Whether unhealthy obsessed with a K-pop idol or radicalized by Facebook, the Internet can be home to some bad stuff. However, just because the Internet can have bad things doesnâ€™t mean that I donâ€™t like it. I think anything can be abused such as drugs, alcohol, and food but to properly engage with those things you need to establish boundaries. I don't believe that "setting boundaries" is a one-size-fits-all soultion to problems on the Internet, yet I feel it has personally helped me establish a good relationship with the Internet.
    Therefore I personally give the Internet 7.7/10 STARS
